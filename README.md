# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-in-Atari-games
• To find an optimal algorithm for Atari games, we compare different algorithms.<br/>
• After reading frontier papers about DQN (Deep Q Network), we run different DQN algorithms, especially Double DQN(DDQN) and Averged Double DQN(ADDQN) by Python in Google Cloud Platform with [TenserFlow/Keras] and [Gym] libraries.<br/>
• We use the based DDQN code from Github and modify by augmenting an ADDQN and a time function.<br/>
